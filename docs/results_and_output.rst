Results and Output
==================

Each time **ATMOS-BUD** is executed, it generates a comprehensive set of results organized within a newly created directory inside the ``ATMOS-BUD_Results`` folder, located in the same directory as the main program. The name of each results directory is based on the input filename, appended with ``_method``, where ``method`` refers to the analysis framework used during the run: either ``fixed``, ``track``, or ``choose``, corresponding to the Fixed, Semi-Lagrangian, or Interactive frameworks.

Users may specify the pressure level (e.g., 700, 850 hPa) for all analyses, as well as independently select whether to track the minimum or maximum of vorticity and/or geopotential height via command-line options. Most diagnostics and outputs reflect these user-defined settings.

Directory Structure and Contents
--------------------------------

Within each results directory, you will find the following files and subdirectories:

``heat_terms/``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contains CSV files with vertically resolved time series for each term in the heat budget equation:

- ``AdvHTemp.csv``: Horizontal advection of temperature  
- ``AdvVTemp.csv``: Vertical advection of temperature  
- ``dTdt.csv``: Temporal derivative of temperature  
- ``Sigma.csv``: Sigma term (static stability)  
- ``Omega.csv``: Omega term (vertical motion)  
- ``ResT.csv``: Residual term (subtraction of all other terms, if multiplied by Cp_d becomes the Adiabatic heating)  

``moisture_terms/``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contains the following diagnostic files:

- ``dQdt.csv``, ``dQdt_integrated.csv``: Temporal derivative of specific humidity and its vertical integration  
- ``divQ.csv``, ``divQ_integrated.csv``: Horizontal divergence of moisture flux and its integrated value  
- ``WaterBudgetResidual.csv``, ``WaterBudgetResidual_integrated.csv``: Residual of the water vapor budget equation  

``vorticity_terms/``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contains terms related to the vorticity budget:

- ``dZdt.csv``: Temporal derivative of relative vorticity  
- ``AdvHZeta.csv``, ``AdvVZeta.csv``: Horizontal and vertical advection of vorticity  
- ``ZetaDivH.csv``: Term from divergence acting on vorticity  
- ``vxBeta.csv``: Meridional advection of planetary vorticity (v·β)  
- ``Tilting.csv``: Tilting term (baroclinic)  
- ``ResZ.csv``: Residual of the vorticity budget  
- ``Zeta.csv``: Raw relative vorticity data over time  

``Figures/``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visual outputs generated during the run:

- ``timeseries-min_max_zeta_hgt.png``: Time series of the minimum or maximum vorticity and geopotential height (according to user-defined options) at the user-selected pressure level
- ``hovmoller_mean_zeta.png``: Hovmöller diagram of mean relative vorticity across pressure levels and time  
- ``track_boxes.png``: Map showing the cyclone track and dynamically selected analysis boxes *(only for ``track`` and ``choose`` frameworks)*  

``Figures/boxes/``
"""""""""""""""""""

Contains individual maps for each time step at the user-selected pressure level (default: 850 hPa):

- Displays vorticity, geopotential height, and the selected analysis domain  
- Marks positions of the minimum or maximum vorticity, minimum or maximum geopotential height, and maximum wind speed, according to user configuration  
- The tracked extremes (min/max) and the pressure level shown are fully customizable by the user via command-line options  

Track-Related Files *(for track and choose frameworks)*
---------------------------------------------------------------

- ``<input>_track_track.csv``: CSV with the complete storm track and diagnostic fields per time step, computed at the user-selected pressure level and for the chosen vorticity/geopotential height extreme (min or max) 
- ``<input>_track.nc``: NetCDF file with the full set of spatial variables over time  
- ``track``: Auxiliary diagnostic file related to the cyclone track  

Log File
--------

- ``log.<input>``: Records all execution steps, including detected issues and time tracking  

Understanding the Output
------------------------

The output files provide both **quantitative diagnostics** (CSV, NetCDF) and **qualitative insights** (visualizations) into the evolution of the atmospheric system.

- The modular structure of heat, moisture, and vorticity terms allows researchers to isolate processes, calculate residuals, and evaluate consistency between different atmospheric budgets.  
- Track files ensure replicability in semi-lagrangian and interactive experiments.  
- The log file offers full traceability of execution.
