Track Framework Tutorial
##########################

This section provides a comprehensive guide to using the **Track (Semi-Lagrangian) Framework** of ATMOS-BUD. The Track framework allows users to analyze the atmospheric budgets for systems that move significantly, such as cyclonic systems.

In this tutorial, we will use data from the **Reg1 cyclone**, which originated in southeastern Brazil and was documented in the article *Dias Pinto, J. R., and R. P. da Rocha (2011), The energy cycle and structural evolution of cyclones over southeastern South America in three case studies, J. Geophys. Res., 116, D14112*. The data for Reg1 comes from the NCEP reanalysis and covers the period from August 8 to August 14, 2005.


Preparing Your Environment
***************************

Before running the program, ensure that your environment is set up correctly. This includes activating the conda environment and preparing the input files.

1. Activate the Conda Environment:
----------------------------------

Activate your conda environment to ensure all dependencies are available:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate atmosbud

2. Prepare Input Files:
-----------------------

The ``track`` file and the ``namelist`` file must be correctly configured in the ``inputs/`` directory. These files define the system's trajectory and the settings for the NCEP reanalysis data.

- **Track file**:  
    The ``track`` file specifies the position (latitude and longitude) of the cyclone for each time step. In this tutorial, we will use the ``track_Reg1-Representative`` file for the Reg1 cyclone.

.. code-block:: bash

   cp inputs/track_Reg1-Representative inputs/track

- **Namelist file for NCEP-R2**:  
    The ``namelist`` file contains the configuration for running the program with the NCEP reanalysis data. Ensure you use the correct namelist configuration for your data.

.. code-block:: bash

   cp inputs/namelist_NCEP-R2 inputs/namelist

Once these steps are completed, you are ready to run the program with the **Track (Semi-Lagrangian) Framework**.

Running ATMOS-BUD with the Track Framework
*********************************************

To run ATMOS-BUD using the **Track Framework**, use the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   python atmos_bud.py path-to-file/your_input_file.nc -t

Replace ``path-to-file/your_input_file.nc`` with the path to your NetCDF input file. For example, analyzing the Reg1 cyclone data:

.. code-block:: bash

   python atmos_bud.py samples/Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2.nc -t

Ensure that the ``namelist`` and ``track`` files are properly configured in the ``inputs/`` directory. Results will be stored in the ``ATMOS-BUD_Results`` directory, and visualizations will be generated for further analysis.

Example Terminal Output
-----------------------

When you run the program, you will see detailed logs in the terminal. Below is an example output for the execution of the program, explaining the key components of the process:

.. code-block:: bash

Explanation of Key Terminal Outputs
-----------------------------------

- **Loading and Preprocessing**:  
  The program first loads the input data (``samples/Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2.nc``), preprocesses it, and then begins the main computation (e.g., computing vorticity and temperature tendencies).
  
.. code-block:: bash

    2025-06-13 10:43:51,977 - atmos_bud - INFO - ⏳ Loading samples/Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2.nc...

By interpreting this output, users can confirm the successful loading of data, the processing of each time step, and the generation of output files for further analysis.

Understanding the Output Files
*********************************************

After running the program, several files and plots are generated. Below is an example of the output directory structure and some of the generated visualizations.

Figures Directory:
---------------------

  The ``Figures/`` folder contains plots that visualize the defined analysis box and the atmospheric conditions within that box for each time step.

  - ``boxes/``: This subfolder contains images of the defined domain box at different time steps. These images are similar to those in the Fixed Framework and show the region of interest for each time step.

  Example of a figure showing the defined box at 850 hPa for August 8, 2005:

  .. image:: _static/images/box_200508080000_track.png
     :alt: Box defined for computations
     :width: 500px
     :align: center

  - ``track_boxes.png``: This plot shows the track of the system, along with the boxes defined for computations.

  - ``hovmoller_mean_zeta.png``: This is a Hovmöller diagram showing the mean vorticity (`ζ`) over time across the domain.

  - ``timeseries_min_zeta_min_hgt_850hPa.png``: This plot contains the time series of the minimum vorticity (`ζ`) and minimum geopotential height (`hgt`) at 850 hPa (minimum or maximum values of vorticity and geopotential height, depending on the ``--track-vorticity`` and ``--track_geopotential`` arguments). This figure is particularly useful for diagnosing the system's behavior and detecting the phases of its life cycle.

NetCDF File:
-------------
ATMOS-BUD will generate a NetCDF file containing all the computed variables for the atmospheric budgets:

  - ``Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2_track.nc``: This file contains the results of the computations performed on the domain defined by the ``track`` file.

Track File
-----------

- ``track``: This is the original track file used to define the cyclone’s path.

- ``Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2_track_track.csv``: This file is generated by the program and includes diagnostic variables for the system's trajectory, computed for the selected pressure level (defined by the ``--level`` argument) and based on the chosen diagnostics (minimum or maximum values of vorticity and geopotential height, depending on the ``--track-vorticity`` and ``--track_geopotential`` arguments). The header of this file looks like:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    time;Lat;Lon;length;width;min_zeta_850;min_hgt_850;max_wind_850


Where:
- ``time``: Time step of the track.
- ``Lat``: Latitude of the system's center.
- ``Lon``: Longitude of the system's center.
- ``length`` and ``width``: Dimensions of the box used for the analysis.
- ``min_zeta_850``: Minimum vorticity at 850 hPa.
- ``min_hgt_850``: Minimum geopotential height at 850 hPa.
- ``max_wind_850``: Maximum wind speed at 850 hPa.

CSV Files:
-------------

In addition to the plots, ATMOS-BUD generates CSV files containing the diagnostic results. These files are organized in subdirectories by budget category: heat, moisture, and vorticity.

Each CSV file contains the following terms:

* **Heat Budget** (`heat_terms/`):
   * ``dTdt``: Temperature tendency (K/s).
   * ``Theta``: Potential temperature (K).
   * ``AdvHTemp``: Horizontal advection of temperature (K/s).
   * ``AdvVTemp``: Vertical advection of temperature (K/s).
   * ``Sigma``: Static stability term (K/Pa).
   * ``ResT``: Residual of the thermodynamic equation (K/s).
   * ``AdiabaticHeating``: Estimated diabatic heating (W/kg).

* **Vorticity Budget** (`vorticity_terms/`):
   * ``Zeta``: Relative vorticity (1/s).
   * ``dZdt``: Vorticity tendency (1/s).
   * ``AdvHZeta``: Horizontal advection of vorticity (1/s²).
   * ``AdvVZeta``: Vertical advection of vorticity (1/s²).
   * ``Beta``: Meridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter (1/m/s).
   * ``vxBeta``: Meridional advection of planetary vorticity (1/s²).
   * ``DivH``: Horizontal divergence of the wind (1/s).
   * ``ZetaDivH``: Term ζ·div(V) (1/s²).
   * ``fDivH``: Term f·div(V) (1/s²).
   * ``Tilting``: Tilting term (1/s²).
   * ``ResZ``: Residual of the vorticity budget (1/s²).

* **Moisture Budget** (`moisture_terms/`):
   * ``dQdt``: Specific humidity tendency (kg/m²/s).
   * ``dQdt_integrated``: Vertically integrated ``dQdt`` (kg/m²/s).
   * ``divQ``: Horizontal divergence of moisture flux (1/s).
   * ``divQ_integrated``: Vertically integrated ``div(Q)`` (kg/m²/s).
   * ``WaterBudgetResidual``: ``dQdt_integrated`` + ``divQ_integrated`` (kg/m²/s).


Log File
-------------
The log file provides details about the execution process.

- ``log.Reg1-Representative_NCEP-R2``: Contains runtime information, including any errors or warnings encountered during execution.

By interpreting these outputs, users can analyze the cyclone’s life cycle and associated atmospheric budgets. The diagnostic plots and CSV files are valuable tools for understanding the behavior of the system over time.

Visualizing Generated Data
***************************

The process of visualizing the output data from the **Track Framework** is exactly the same as in the **Fixed Framework**. For detailed instructions on how to visualize the generated variables, please refer to the **Visualizing Generated Data** section in the **Fixed Framework Tutorial**.

In summary:
    * Use the provided visualization scripts, such as ``map_example.py`` and ``vertical-profiles_example.py``, to generate maps and vertical profile plots from the resulting NetCDF files and CSV data.
    * These scripts can be found in the ``plots/`` directory.
